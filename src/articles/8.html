<h1>INFORMATION CAPTURE AND STORAGE</h1>
<p>
    Psychologists say that for each piece of new information to be assimilated
    and stored in the memory it has to be repeated at least seven times.<br />
    This means that if we want to learn foreign words, technical terms and
    definitions, we need to repeat them several times, which requires time
    input.
</p>
<h2>Leisure Time</h2>
<p>
    <b>Where can we get additional time for learning?</b><br />
    We can make better use of time otherwise wasted in queues, in transport, or
    we can study while relaxing on the sofa.
    <br />
    Get this time with the help of our mobile phones.

    of your mobile phone.

<h3>Guessing Made Easy!</h3>
<p>
    You can read the definition of the word, which is hidden behind
    asterisks.<br />
    To guess the word, you have to enter letter by letter, choosing one of the
    three suggested letters. <br />
    This makes the guessing process easy. You can get hints. <br />
    The hints options are: you can either open any of the letters in the word,
    <br />
    or you can press “Hint”. This will help you guess the right answer.<br />
