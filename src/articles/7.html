<h4>We must as much as possible to help our memory:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>open any part of words</li>
    <li>to give a description of a word</li>
    <li>give a hint</li>
    <li>show all letters</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This must be a bit like a crossword puzzle. Due to this process can be fun.
    The words are simple for repetition and you probably already know them. But
    the dictionary entry describes the word with lots of meanings and youâ€™ll be
    a little confusing. Serious help for your memory will have all letters
    immediately in front of you.

<h3>There are two types of prompts:</h3>

        words where you made mistakes or used the hint.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="callouts">
    <p>
        <b>Knowledge of the core set of words in English is necessary.</b><br />
        Test yourself. You can recognize simple English words by description
        from dictionary article?
