<p>
    <b>The purpose of EasyLang is watching films in English.</b><br />The sense
    is that you can replay a phrase a lot of times and listen in details. You
    also canÂ manage the filter by steps using subtitles.
</p>
<p>
    Services for translation and a better understanding of foreign language are
    built in the program. Nothing can substitute real-life language. Try to
    compare your English teacher pronunciation with a person, who lived in an
    English-speaking environment at least for 3 years.
