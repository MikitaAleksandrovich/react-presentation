    EasyLang is the free program also for watching movies with subtitles.
    <br />
    Now it is very easy to follow the movie. The film can be watched on the
    steps of-phrase from the subtitles. You can easily repeat some phrases to
    gain a better understanding. An interesting movie with a native speaker is
    one of the best ways of learning a foreign language. You will hear the real
    language and not typical educational material. The plot of the film will
    help you to learn and remember new words effectively and easily. Later it
    will become much easier to repeat these words while watching a movie.

    As you know, the best way to learn a foreign language is a natural
    linguistic environment, where the language is produced and used naturally.
    Unfortunately, many of us can’t afford to travel very often or to stay in
    any country for a long time. However, movies give you this great possibility
    to immerse yourself in this environment and to feel a real language. Even if
    you are all beat up, watching an interesting film is always pleasant
    pastime. You will spend more time both on your studies and on the things you
    like to do.

<p>
    So… sit on the couch, take your laptop watching your favorite movies and
    enjoy the learning process!
