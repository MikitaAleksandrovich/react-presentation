<p>
    Start to watch films or read articles with the EasyLang.app.<br />
    You will highlight unfamiliar words/phrases for repeating.
</p>
<p>
    Try to do it before going to sleep. Next day try to go through this lesson
    in “EasyLang.app”.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you do not completely recall word/phrase, you would subconsciously
    choose the right letter and complete the lesson.

<h2>How to enhance your skills?</h2>
<p>
    People with extraordinary memory abilities often have their mnemonic system.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the people in regular circumstances need to have a context from real
    life as the substitution for this mnemonic. The scenes from the watched
    movie are acceptable mnemonics for our memory, and the plot maximally brings
    us to real language conditions.
</p>
<p>
    But this is the insufficient condition. It is necessary to review the
    studied material once and once again.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes polyglots stating that they previously did not have such a good
    memory. That they have just practised.<br />
    So anyone can become a polyglot.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to enhance memory by practising, just like any other
    abilities.
</p>
<h2>The learning material must attract you</h2>
<p>
    Interesting movie or a book as a learning material motivates and catches
    your attention.<br />
    Repeat words on the next day after watching a movie.<br />
    You will be surprised by the results.<br />
    And feelings of boredom will leave your learning process.
